• Simulated a fully functional self-driving car model with Convolutional Neural Network and Computer Vision which
could correctly predict turns and stops. Implemented different dimensionality reduction techniques such as correlation matrix, PCA and singular value
decomposition to identify the features that affect the target variable the most.
• Trained a deep learning model that can successfully identify between 43 different traffic signs and drive without unwanted stops and crashes.
